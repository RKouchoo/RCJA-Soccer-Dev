  CURREENT STATE:



  -=- Re-Writing Main setup code in a seperate file, debunk code issues and decide if its a hardware issue


  
  TODO LIST:
  
  - Set up light sensor hardware in robot
  
  - create a startup config program for the light sensors
  
  - wire up compass
  
  - get serial screen working, outputting what would be in the console
  
  - write code for the compass to auto align when not much is happening
  
  - create a heading compass system, later when we have two robots we NOTE: i have pre setup the variables
    can use the heading system for robots to return to original location
    
  - figure out why robot goes spazz when lthe ightsensors are not reporting any data 
    potentially has something to do with booleans and conditionals
    
  - dress the robot and make it look pretty LEDS LEDS LEDS AND MORE
  
  - work on a random defence timer, robot going back into its half and then strafe defending.
